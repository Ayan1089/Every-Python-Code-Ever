##### Rules to be followed:
1. Every python code must include **comments**.</br>
   **Single-line** comments: for cases like what does a function or block of code do.</br>
   **Multi-line** comments: for explaining the function for a beginner or at the sta
   rt of program.</br>
2. Use camelCase or underscore_between_words.
3. save the file as **[program]_username.py** </br>
   [program] to be replaced by what does the program do.
4. **Don't** edit/change files of any other user.
